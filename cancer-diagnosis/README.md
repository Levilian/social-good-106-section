# Cancer Diagnosis - k-Nearest Neighbors Classification

## Intro
In this workshop, we'll use the k-Nearest Neighbors clustering algorithm to classify bbreast cancer data to make diagnoses. The data consists of various indicators on breast tumor scans to classify the tumors as malignant or benign.

## The Data
This data is taken from the Univeristy of Wisconsin's Breast Cancer Diagnostic Set, taken from the UC Irvine Machine Learning repository. If you're interested in looking at the data set and spec, it's listed [here](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+%28Diagnostic%29).

The features are radius, texture, perimeter, area, smoothness, compactness, concavity, concave points, symmetry, and fractal dimension or a digitized fine needle aspirate image.

## Your Task

Using the starter code in the repo, implement the k-Nearest Neighbors clustering. Instructions are detailed in ‘cancer-classify’ for you.
