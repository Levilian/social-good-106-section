# CS 106: Social Good Section

Here, you can find resources, workshop materials, and code snippets for the examples we'll be working through in lecture! Before each workshop, we'll try and post any starter code. After each week's section, we'll include some additional resources for extensions mentioned during class.

As always, if you have any questions feel free to reach out to your course staff (emails on syllabus).
