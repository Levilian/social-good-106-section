# Sentiment Analysis - Classifying Anti-Refugee Tweets

## Intro
This workshop centers on how we can leverage social media platforms to do gradual education of people whose views we fundamentally disagree with. A fitting example of this is the virulent and hateful response to the Syrian refugee crisis from Twitter users in US and Europe. Many individuals took to Twitter to voice their Islamophobic, xenophobic, and racist opinions that refugees should not be allowed to seek sanctuary lest they bring terror, rape, and other unfounded accusations. 

## Your Task
The tweetmaster.js file contains a huge dump of tweets we've pulled showcasing both pro-refugee and anti-refugee sentiment. Today, you'll be working on classifying these sentiments based on trends that you find, whether simple text matching or more elaborate patterns.

This is a fairly open-ended task, and there are lots of ways to go about it! Feel free to partner up in groups, definitely ask for help in terms of getting documentation or guidance in proceeding with the analysis, and share your findings.

## Extensions
Now that you can classify tweet sentiment, there are some awesome future applications! One that we thought of is building a tweetbot that responds to hateful tweets with helpful resources to constructively respond and hopefully start an educational conversation about why hating refugees is not the problem, why it's racism (why racism is bad), and the like.
